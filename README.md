## Instructions for Code Reviewers

Thank you for taking the time to review my code. Please follow the steps below to get the project running on your local machine:

1. **Install Dependencies**

   - Navigate to the root directory of the project.
   - Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Start the Live Server**

   - Once the dependencies are installed, you can start a live server to view the project in your browser.
   - If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the Live Server extension by right-clicking on `index.html` and selecting "Open with Live Server."

3. **Navigate Through the Project**
   - Once the live server is running, it should open the `index.html` page by default.

Please feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions you might have!
